    "  - UK Census Data\n",
    "    - The UK Census data file for and Socio-economic Classification (NS SEC) [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/TS062/editions/2021/versions/5) or [here](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_bulk). Use the most detailed area type (Output Areas).\n",
    "    - One other UK Census data file of your choosing [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/search?topics=9731,6646,3845,9497,4262,4128,7755,4994,6885,9724,7367&filter=datasets) or [here](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_bulk). Use the most detailed area type available.\n",
    "    - Geographic coordinates of Census Output Areas [here](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/4d4e021d-fe98-4a0e-88e2-3ead84538537/output-areas-december-2021-boundaries-ew-bgc-v2).\n",
    "  - Spatial data\n",
    "    - Set up an API connection to Open Street Maps [here](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Optionally, to be able to use more data in training, you might want to also download the entire map for England (or more) [here](https://download.openstreetmap.fr/extracts/) or [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2. Structure the data, and upload it to your AWS database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Census datasets can be huge and unwieldy to manipulate directly in python frameworks such as pandas. As a result we will host the data in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a cloud hosted database (such as MariaDB hosted on the AWS RDS service),  you will construct a database containing tables that contain per-output-area data, latitudes and longitudes of the output areas, and potentially, extracted selected open street maps features from the country-wide data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you set the correct indices on your data, which will allow your code to run much faster. Hint: create an index on any columns you will be looking up, and joint indices if your lookup involves multiple columns (like coordinates).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely find the following resources helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lecture 1, 2 and 3.\n",
    "- Lab class 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Note, this particular dataset could probably be handled directly in pandas, but you are explicitly tasked with using a database. This is a compromise from previous iterations of this course, where students spent quite a lot of time struggling from the size of the data. This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your skills, as well as prepare for the second part of the assessment where databases might be necessary. Approach that do not use databases where needed will be penalised during marking.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.0. Explore the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - To make predictions you will augment your data with information obtained from Open Street Map: an open license source of mapping information. You will need to use the techniques you have learnt in the course to indentify and incorporate useful features for your prediction tasks.\n",
    "  - Look at the percentage of students (NS SEC code L15) in the individual output areas, and explore how it's related to various types of open street map features in those locations. Use the relationships you found to suggest the features to be used in a system that predicts percentage of students in a given area.\n",
    "  - Do the same for an additional census variable (e.g., the average age in a given area).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.0. Make a prediction system.\n",
    "- Use Open Street Maps to predict Socio-Economic Status - in particular, the percent of full time students, from OSM features. Your function should take as input a coordinate pair (you can assume it will be in England), and return an estimate for the share of students in that area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do the same for the additional census variable you selected in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *Some of the census data sheets are very detailed. You might want to try \"boiling them down\" to some aggregate value or selecting just the most important columns.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *This assignment is focused on data pipelines, rather than machine learning, so we do not expect any advanced architectures here - a linear model or similar is perfectly fine.*\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *For data exploration, or picking your second dataset, you may find useful the [interactive map](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/) of the census data.*"

    "- Your project should be based on the Census, Price Paid, OSM and Election datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some guidelines:\n",
    "- Do not make a miniproject that furthers discriminatory rhetoric. In general, avoid topics that could be insensitive. If in doubt, message Radzim Sendyka (and *cc* Christian Cabrera) to discuss if this applies to your idea.\n",
    "- Please avoid any projects that would require approval from the ethics comittee.\n",
    "- Pick the scope of your projects that will allow you to show your skills. Some projects might not be challenging enough while others might be hard to make any progress in. Don't be scared to report negative results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please email Radzim Sendyka (and *cc* Christian Cabrera) with your project idea when you begin working on it, so we can let you know about any potential concerns (eg. potentially insensive, too off-topic, too simple, too complex) as soon as we can. You can change the topic up to the submission deadline, but let us know again in cases of major changes."
